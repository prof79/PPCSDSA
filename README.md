## C# Data Structures and Algorithms Samples ##

This repository contains exercises and examples based on the great book
["C# Data Structures and Algorithms"](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/c-data-structures-and-algorithms-0)
(C) 2018 by Marcin Jamro from [Packt Publishing](https://packtpub.com).
The examples sometimes closely follow the original, sometimes they don't -
they are my own attempts with my own previous C# language and patterns
knowledge after all.

They are also a good reference for how certain things are done or
certain traps look like.
